# @m4trix/core - Contributor README

The readme of the package is available in `package/README.md`.

A powerful TypeScript library for building AI-driven web applications. This package provides modular entry points like `@m4trix/core`, `@m4trix/core/ui`, and `@m4trix/core/stream`.

# Principles
  - **Event driven** – Components communicate via events; loose coupling and composability.
  - **Agent definition and orchestration decoupling** – Define agents separately from how they are orchestrated and composed.
  - Make product developers lives easier to implement AI features
  - DX First
  - Typescript first
  - Treeshaking friendly - You get what you need, nothing more, nothing less
  - API as readable as possible. What you read is what you get.
  - Agnostic. No vendor lock-in. Adapters... Adapters... Adapters...
  - Made with the brain of a product developer profcient in typescript - not half baked SDK with unstable types.
