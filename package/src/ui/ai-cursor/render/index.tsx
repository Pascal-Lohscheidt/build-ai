/**
 * The AI Cursor is a SolidJS component.
 * Why solid js?
 * solid js is tiny on memory and bundle size. Fast to render.
 *
 * And it is more commonly known than most Web Component libraries.
 * Downside?
 * We have to be way more careful when we scope designs.
 *
 * Longterm Goal? replace this with a Web Component. Preferably with Lit.
