# Changelog + Migration Guides

## Where to Find Updates

- **GitHub** — [Releases](https://github.com/Pascal-Lohscheidt/m4trix/releases) and commit history

## Migration Guides

When we introduce breaking changes, we will publish migration guides in the release notes and in this documentation. During alpha, changes may be documented in:

- Release notes on GitHub
- This changelog page
- Inline deprecation warnings in the codebase

## Staying Up to Date

- Watch the repository for releases
- Pin versions in production until the API stabilizes
- Run `pnpm update @m4trix/core` (or your package manager) to check for updates
