# Versioning + Stability

## Current Status: Alpha

m4trix is currently in **alpha**. The API may change without notice. We welcome feedback and contributions.

## Stability Guarantees

- **Alpha** — Breaking changes possible; we aim to document them when they occur
- **Beta** (future) — Minor version bumps for breaking changes; patch for fixes
- **Stable** (future) — Semantic versioning with clear deprecation cycles

## Versioning

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (semver) where applicable:

- **Major** — Breaking changes
- **Minor** — New features, backward compatible
- **Patch** — Bug fixes, backward compatible

During alpha, we may release without strict semver adherence. Check the [Changelog](changelog-migrations.md) and release notes for details.
